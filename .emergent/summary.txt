<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully transformed a basic multi-agency travel accounting system into a feature-rich application. Initial work established the full-stack architecture, including FastAPI, MongoDB, and React with Shadcn UI. Key features implemented were a robust authentication with JWT and RBAC, multi-agency data isolation, and a functional dashboard.

The development trajectory shows a methodical approach, iteratively addressing user requests and debugging issues. Major efforts included fixing a persistent frontend login event handling bug (which was temporarily deferred), implementing comprehensive backend reports (Sales, Aging, Profit/Loss), and significantly enhancing the frontend UI/UX with professional Arabic translations, a new sidebar navigation, and a notification system.

Subsequent work focused on fixing critical permissions: ensuring the General Manager could view all agencies' data across all modules (Invoices, Payments, Operations Management) and enabling the General Accountant to manage and filter operations across all agencies. A major security enhancement was the integration of Google Authentication for both new and existing users. Finally, the reports system was refined to allow agency-specific breakdowns and filtering, and the profit aspect was removed as requested. The work often involved fixing JSX errors introduced during large frontend updates. The current state has the backend fully functional, including the latest report enhancements, with frontend integration and testing pending for these reports.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a multi-agency accounting web application for Sanhaja Travel Agencies, localized for Algeria. Core requirements included:
1.  **Authentication**: Role-based access (General Manager, General Accountant, Agency Staff) with hierarchical permissions, later enhanced with Google Authentication.
2.  **Database**: Agencies, Users, Clients, Suppliers, Bookings, Invoices, Payments, Cashboxes, JournalEntries, ChartOfAccounts, with all data isolated per agency.
3.  **CRUD Interfaces**: For all entities, with filters and search functionality.
4.  **Key Screens**: Dashboard (daily income/expenses, cash balance, unpaid invoices, weekly bookings), invoice creation from booking (with TVA, PDF export), payment recording, comprehensive reports (daily/monthly sales, aging, journal, trial balance).
5.  **Multi-agency Isolation**: Users see only their agency's data, with General Manager and General Accountant able to view/filter all agency data.
6.  **Bilingual UI**: Arabic/French with language selector and professional, well-organized navigation.
7.  **Notifications (Implemented)**: Invoice due, low cashbox, backup/restore failure alerts.
8.  **System Management**: User management (add, edit, delete, roles) and daily reports with approval workflow.
The application now supports all these features with enhanced UI/UX and robust backend functionality.

<code_architecture>

-   **/app/backend/server.py**: The core FastAPI backend. It was extensively modified to:
    - Define all database models (Agencies, Users, Clients, Suppliers, Bookings, Invoices, Payments, Cashboxes, JournalEntries, ChartOfAccounts, Session, DailyReport).
    - Implement authentication endpoints (, , , ).
    - Add CRUD routes for various entities, ensuring multi-agency data isolation and specific role-based access (General Manager, General Accountant, Agency Staff).
    - Implement comprehensive reports (Sales, Aging, Daily, Profit/Loss now Sales Report) with filtering and agency breakdown.
    - Handle permission logic and user management endpoints.
-   **/app/backend/seed_data.py**: Provides initial sample data. It was read to retrieve user credentials.
-   **/app/backend/.env**: Contains critical environment variables like  and .
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main React application file. This file received the most significant modifications:
    - Routing logic, global context for authentication, language settings.
    - UI components for Login, Dashboard, Clients/Suppliers Management, Bookings, Invoices, Payments, Reports, User Management, Daily Reports, and Profile.
    - Extensive UI design, form handling, API integration, bilingual text rendering (Arabic/French).
    - Refined navigation structure, dashboard enhancements, notification system.
    - Debugging and fixing multiple JSX syntax errors and event handling issues.
    - Integration of Google Authentication UI and state management.
-   **/app/frontend/.env**: Stores  and implicitly was to store  for frontend API calls.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/ui/button.jsx**: A Shadcn UI component that was inspected during frontend debugging.
-   **/app/frontend/package.json**: Manages frontend dependencies, with  added for Google Auth.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Frontend integration and testing for the enhanced reports (agency-wise breakdown, date filters).
-   Address any remaining minor UI/UX refinements or edge cases identified during the final frontend testing phase.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the reports system. The user requested that reports should display data for each agency separately, provide combined totals for all agencies, allow filtering by date, and remove the profit calculation from the Profit/Loss report.

The AI successfully updated the backend in . Specifically:
-   The , , and  (which now functions as a modified sales/revenue report without profit) endpoints were updated.
-   These endpoints now accept new query parameters:  (boolean to group results by agency) and  (list of agency IDs to filter specific agencies).
-   The  logic was modified to remove profit-related calculations, fulfilling the user's request.
-   The backend was restarted and  confirmed that these new report functionalities are working correctly, including agency breakdown and filtering.

On the frontend, the  component in  was updated to incorporate the new agency and date filters, and to display the report data with the agency-wise breakdown as requested. The backend changes are fully implemented and tested, and the frontend changes for displaying these enhanced reports have been made.

<optional_next_step>
Test the enhanced reports system on the frontend to ensure the new filters and display logic work correctly.
